        <p>hamburger, also called burger, ground beef. The term is applied variously to (1) a <br>patty of ground beef, sometimes called hamburg steak, Salisbury steak, or Vienna steak,<br> (2) a sandwich consisting of a patty of ground beef served within a split bread roll, <br>with various garnishes, or (3) the ground beef itself, which is used as a base in many <br>sauces, casseroles, terrines, and the like.<br>

        The origin of hamburger is unknown, but the hamburger patty and sandwich were probably <br>brought by 19th-century German immigrants to the United States, where in a matter of <br>decades the hamburger came to be considered an archetypal American food. The importance<br> of the hamburger in American popular culture is indicated by its virtual <br>ubiquity at backyard barbecues and on fast-food restaurant menus and by the <br>proliferation of so-called hamburger stands and restaurants. Some chains, such as McDonald’s,<br> Burger King, and Wendy’s,<br> proliferated worldwide.</p>
